# putnam-and-beyond-guide-detailed-solutions-ge
Expanding Putnam and Beyond into my handwritten detailed guide that explains not just how to solve problems, but how to think like a top competition mathematician. [Georgian]


This repository contains a **handwritten, scanned companion** to the book *Putnam and Beyond*, written in **Georgian**. It is intended for students who want to go far beyond the very brief official solutions and develop **deep, competition-level mathematical thinking**.

The original book is one of the most respected and most challenging collections for advanced problem solving. It is also frequently described as **difficult to use without strong prior experience**, because many solutions are extremely short. This companion is my attempt to **bridge that gap** for serious students.

## What this companion is

This project contains **hundreds of problems** from *Putnam and Beyond*, each with:

- **Very detailed, line-by-line solutions** written in Georgian,
- Explanations of **every strategy choice** and why it works,
- Discussion of **alternative ideas** when relevant,
- Emphasis on **recognizing patterns and triggers**:
  - why a substitution appears,
  - why a certain inequality is the right one,
  - why a specific viewpoint unlocks the problem.

The goal is not only to solve each problem, but to show **how someone experienced actually thinks** while solving it.

## Designed for the hardest competitions

The level and style are aimed at:

- Students preparing for **Putnam**, **IMO**, **IMC**, and other high-level contests,
- Advanced undergraduates moving toward **theoretical mathematics** (analysis, algebra, number theory, combinatorics),
- Anyone who wants to train the kind of deep reasoning needed for modern **theoretical CS / AI / ML**.

The original book itself warns that it is not ideal for beginners without substantial experience. This companion is written for those who **want to dive deep anyway** and are ready to push themselves.

## Color-coded key insights (green & yellow)

In the handwritten notes, certain lines or sections are highlighted in **green** or **yellow**.  

These markings are **not decoration** – they indicate:

- the **most important facts** in that solution,
- the **key conceptual step** that really “grabs” the problem,
- the idea that you should remember and reuse on other problems.

When you read:

- Treat green / yellow sections as the **core insight of the method**.
- Ask yourself:  
  *“If I had seen only this highlighted part, could I have reconstructed the rest of the solution?”*

If the answer eventually becomes “yes”, you have truly absorbed the technique.

## Language and format

- All solutions are written in **Georgian**.
- The document is **handwritten and scanned**, but carefully prepared and cleaned so that:
  - the writing is readable,
  - the structure of each solution is clear,
  - important ideas can be visually distinguished.

This is meant to feel like working through a **personal notebook of a competition mathematician**, not like reading a printed textbook.

## How to study with this companion

A suggested way to use these notes:

1. **Start from the original book**  
   Read the problem in *Putnam and Beyond*. Think about it on your own first, even if only briefly.

2. **Then open the corresponding solution here**  
   Follow the reasoning line by line in Georgian.

3. **Pay special attention to the highlighted parts**  
   These are the “hinge points” of the argument:
   - the substitution that changes everything,
   - the inequality that suddenly fits perfectly,
   - the structural observation that simplifies the whole problem.

4. **Afterward, close the notes and reconstruct**  
   Try to recreate the solution from memory, focusing on:
   - the main idea,
   - the sequence of key steps,
   - why that idea was natural in hindsight.

Over time, this builds not just knowledge of **solutions**, but a library of **reusable mental patterns**.

## Relationship to *Putnam and Beyond* and copyright

- This is an **unofficial companion** to the book *Putnam and Beyond*.  
  It is **not** affiliated with or endorsed by the authors or the publisher.
- The repository contains **only my own handwritten solutions, commentary, and strategy notes**.
- The **problem statements and original text** of *Putnam and Beyond* are **not reproduced here**.  
  They belong to the original authors and publisher.
- To work with these notes, you should **own or legally access a copy of *Putnam and Beyond***.

If any part of the material even one problem is ever considered too close to the original text, I am willing to adjust or remove it. The intention of this project is educational: to help students understand and appreciate the book at a deeper level, **not** to replace it.

## Files

The main document in this repository is:

- `putnam_beyond_georgian_companion.pdf`  
  *(rename this line if your file has a different name)*

It contains the handwritten, scanned solutions and strategy notes.

## Author

This companion is the product of **years of personal work** on advanced problem solving, with the goal of:

- training myself to think at **competition and graduate level**, and
- giving other students a way to study **deep, fully explained solutions** in Georgian.

If you have comments, questions, or suggestions, feel free to open an issue on this repository. This is just part of whole project and probably will make continuation of this repository in the future.
